    <p class="elements"> The first thing I had to do was learn about the key design elements,</p>
    <p>These elements include Line, Shape, Color, Texture, Space, Form, and Value.</p> 
    <p>Understanding these elements is crucial for creating visually appealing designs.</p>
    <p class="certificate">After learning about the elements I took an exam and earned a certificate.</p>

    <p class="principle"> Next, I learned about the Principles of Design, which include Balance, Contrast, Emphasis, Movement, Pattern, Rhythm, and Unity. These principles help in organizing the design elements effectively.</p>
    <p>Then, I created a design project that incorporated both the elements and principles of design.</p>
    <p>For this project I had to make a holloween themed flyer using the elements and principles of design.</p>

    <p> Finally, I worked on a Graphic Design project where I had to create a poster about 1 of the key design elements, I chose "The Color Theory".</p>
